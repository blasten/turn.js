<h2>The West Coast Computer Faire</h2>
<p>
The new company got ready to show off their product at the West Coast Computer Faire, a conference held in San Francisco in April 1977. It was only
a prototype, but the plastic case definitely made the Apple II look like a professional product. Steve negotiated a prime spot for Apple’s booth, and
took precious advice from both Mike Markkula and Regis McKenna. That’s why he bought his first suit for the occasion.

My recollection is we stole the show

Apple Computer received 300 orders for the Apple II on the show alone,
twice as much as the total number of Apple I’s ever sold! But this was just the beginning.
