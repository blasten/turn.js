The iPhone project started in 2003 — although rumors about such a
product had circulated even before that, with the much-hyped Apple PDA. The basic idea was to build a digital convergence product, the ultimate
digital device that would combine a phone, PDA, and iPod. Actually, Apple had already moved into the phone business with the Motorola ROCKR in
late 2005 — a standard chipset that was compatible with iTunes. But the product was lame, and it was just a temporary solution before Apple came
up with its own phone.
